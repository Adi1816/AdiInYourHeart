            <h3>Tech Enthusiast</h3>
            <p>When faced with the choice between CSE at BIT Mesra and non-circuital branches at IIT, I thought, "Why swim in the ocean of possibilities when I can surf the waves of coding greatness at BIT?" This is the level of Tech Madness I have inside me. Coding is my jam, and who knows, maybe I'll code Google's way to Mars someday! Bring on the nerdy algorithms and let's conquer the tech world, one line of code at a time!ðŸš€</p>
